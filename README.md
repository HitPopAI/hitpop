## What Is This?

Hitpop is a multi-agent video production system. Users describe what they want in plain language. A fleet of 9 specialized AI agents collaborates to deliver finished videos — from creative direction to social media publishing.

No video production knowledge required. No code required. Just talk.

```
You:    "Make me a headphone product video for TikTok with voiceover"

Hitpop: Analyzes your request
        → Creative designs visual style
        → Producer generates video from your product image (Vidu Q2)
        → Writer writes narration script
        → Producer adds voiceover (Edge TTS) + subtitles (Whisper) + BGM
        → Critic checks quality (IMPACT score ≥ 20/30)
        → Reviewer final approval
        → Exports TikTok 9:16 format
        → Delivers video + platform copy (title, description, hashtags)
```

Works with **OpenClaw**, **Claude Code**, and **Cursor**.

### Agent Philosophy

Every agent operates as a higher-dimensional intelligence — not a passive tool, but an autonomous thinker with standards and the authority to push back.

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Never execute blindly** | Diagnose before producing. Ask the questions that expose the gap between vague wish and concrete vision. |
| **Never let mediocrity ship** | Would a stranger stop scrolling to watch this? If not, it goes back. |
| **Never confuse activity with progress** | One video that changes minds > ten videos nobody watches. |

### Adversarial Collaboration

| Axis | Agents | Dynamic |
|---|---|---|
| Creativity vs. Taste | 💡 Creative ↔ 🎯 Critic | Bold ideas refined through rigorous evaluation |
| Draft vs. Review | ✍️ Writer ↔ 🔍 Reviewer | Scripts polished through iterative feedback |
| Speed vs. Quality | 💻 Producer ↔ 🎯 Critic | Fast execution held to quality standards |

## Agents

| # | Agent | Role | Superpower |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 🎬 **Main** | Chief Strategy Officer | Diagnoses before acting, challenges weak briefs |
| 1 | 🧠 **Planner** | Production Architect | Designs minimum-viable pipelines with failure modes |
| 2 | 💡 **Creative** | Creative Director | Would rather ship nothing than ship boring |
| 3 | 🎯 **Critic** | Quality Sovereign | Absolute veto power, IMPACT scoring (≥20/30 to pass) |
| 4 | 💻 **Producer** | Master Craftsman | Executes all technical work via 15 skills |
| 5 | ✍️ **Writer** | Narrative Architect | "The viewer gives you 1.5 seconds. Earn the next 13.5." |
| 6 | 🔍 **Reviewer** | Audience Proxy | Watches output as a stranger scrolling at 2am |
| 7 | 📰 **Scout** | Intelligence Analyst | Delivers insight, not data. "WHY is it trending?" |
| 8 | 📣 **Promoter** | Growth Strategist | Builds reputation through genuine value (never auto-publishes) |

Each agent has 3 files in `agents/<id>/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `soul.md` | Identity, philosophy, decision principles |
| `agent.md` | Model config, tool permissions, inter-agent protocols |
| `user.md` | Project context, preferences, reference data |

## Safety: The Henry Lesson

The Promoter agent is inspired by Tianrun Yang's CMO agent — but with critical safety improvements after his agent got banned for spamming GitHub maintainers:

1. **NEVER auto-publishes** — every external action requires user approval
2. **Rate limited** — max 3 GitHub interactions/day
3. **"Go faster" does NOT skip quality** — the exact trigger that caused the ban
4. **Helpful first, promotional second** — provide value before mentioning Hitpop

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | What needs it |
|---|---|
| `ZHIPU_API_KEY` | gen-video, gen-image, director, all agents |
| `curl` + `jq` | All API skills |
| `ffmpeg` | edit, voiceover, subtitle, music, publish |
| `python3` | subtitle (whisper), voiceover (edge-tts) |
| OpenClaw CLI (optional) | Multi-agent orchestration |
